# PacketTrail Analytics

PacketTrail Analytics is a network traffic analysis project designed to transform raw traffic data into actionable insights from a security and audit perspective.

## Project Overview
Organizations generate massive amounts of network traffic data every day. PacketTrail Analytics simulates how this data can be processed, analyzed, and summarized to identify unusual usage patterns, high-risk behavior, and potential system weaknesses.

The project focuses on:
- Identifying high-usage IP addresses
- Detecting activity on non-standard ports
- Summarizing traffic trends for audit review

## Technologies Used
- Python
- SQLite
- SQL
- Git

## Key Features
- Parses simulated network traffic logs
- Stores structured traffic data in a relational database
- Generates summary metrics for analysis and review

## Project Status
**Completed (Academic Project)**

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time traffic ingestion
- Visualization dashboard
- Integration with cloud-based log sources
