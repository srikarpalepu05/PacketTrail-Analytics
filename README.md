# PacketTrail Analytics

PacketTrail Analytics is a network traffic analysis project designed to convert raw traffic data into structured insights from a security and operational perspective.

The project simulates how organizations ingest, store, and analyze network activity to identify abnormal behavior, high-usage endpoints, and potential risk indicators.

## Project Goals
- Structure raw network traffic data
- Store traffic logs in a relational database
- Analyze usage patterns and anomalies
- Produce summaries useful for review and decision-making

## Technologies
- Python
- SQLite
- SQL
- CSV-based data ingestion

## How It Works
1. Raw traffic data is ingested from CSV files
2. Data is stored in a local SQLite database
3. Analytical queries identify trends and risk indicators
4. A summary report is generated

## Project Status
Completed

## Future Improvements
- Support for real-time traffic ingestion
- Visualization layer
- Cloud-based data sources
